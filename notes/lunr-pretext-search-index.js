This requires logic . We'll introduce some basic concepts and notation, as well as connections to sets.     Propositions and Operations       In classical logic, we deal with statements called propositions : statements that are unambiguously true or false.  \"My name is Jeff\" is a proposition because it is unambiguously true. \"It is too hot today\" is not proposition. \" \" is a proposition because it is unambiguously false.  There are a few basic operations we can perform on the propositions and :    : \"not \", called the negation of      : \" and \", called the conjunction of and      : \" or \", called the disjunction of and         Truth Tables   Operations on propositions result in new propositions. To keep track of the resulting truth values, we can use truth tables .
