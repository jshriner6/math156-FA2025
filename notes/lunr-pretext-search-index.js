This requires logic . We'll introduce some basic concepts and notation, as well as connections to sets.     Propositions and Operations       In classical logic, we deal with statements called propositions : statements that are unambiguously true or false.  \"My name is Jeff\" is a proposition because it is unambiguously true. \"It is too hot today\" is not proposition. \" \" is a proposition because it is unambiguously false.  There are a few basic operations we can perform on the propositions and :    : \"not \", called the negation of      : \" and \", called the conjunction of and      : \" or \", called the disjunction of and         Truth Tables   Operations on propositions result in new propositions. To keep track of the resulting truth values, we can use truth tables .

For the first step, we draw a line vertically down the middle of the square and color the right half:  Square getting colored.    Since the square has area 1, the area of the shaded region is 1\/2. For the next step, we draw a horizontal line through the remaining space and color in the top quarter:  Square getting colored again.  At this point, the shaded region has area . We continue this process, at each step coloring half of the remaining space.    Draw the square after three steps. What is the area of the shaded region? Write this as both an expanded sum, and as a single fraction.     Square colored after three steps  Area is .      Draw the square after four steps. What is the area of the shaded region?

Write down a sum that expresses the area after steps. Write it in both expanded form and in sigma-notation.           In the previous problem, you may have noticed a pattern in your final answers. Use this to guess a simple formula for the area after steps (in other words, simplify so your answer is no longer a sum).           Based on this formula, what can you infer about the area of the shaded region as tends toward infinity? Does this make geometric sense? Why or why not?    The area approaches 1 as goes to infinity. This makes sense, because the square has area 1, and the shaded region is always contained inside the square. The non-shaded region gets cut in half each time, so the shaded area should approach 1.         Now let’s talk about general geometric sequences and series. A geometric sequence is defined by an initial term  and constant ratio  , and looks like this: Partial geometric sums are just the partial sums of geometric sequences.
