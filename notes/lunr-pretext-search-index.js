This requires logic . We'll introduce some basic concepts and notation, as well as connections to sets.     Propositions and Operations       In classical logic, we deal with statements called propositions : statements that are unambiguously true or false.  \"My name is Jeff\" is a proposition because it is unambiguously true. \"It is too hot today\" is not proposition. \" \" is a proposition because it is unambiguously false.  There are a few basic operations we can perform on the propositions and :    : \"not \", called the negation of      : \" and \", called the conjunction of and      : \" or \", called the disjunction of and         Truth Tables   Operations on propositions result in new propositions. To keep track of the resulting truth values, we can use truth tables .

  "body": " : Equivalence Relations and Partitions    Motivation: Equivalence Relations       There are many cases when it's desirable to \"loosen\" our concept of equality. For example, in most contexts we accept the equality even though the two sides of the equality contain different looking symbols. This is captured in the concept of an equivalence relation .     Definition: Equivalence Relation   A binary relation on is an equivalence relation if    it is relexive, symmetric, and transitive.     Example: Equivalence Relations   Let be the relation on defined by if and only if is even.    This is an equivalence relation because   It is reflexive: , which is even.    It is symmetric: If is even, then is even.    It is transitive: If and are even, then is even.          Observations: Equivalence Relations          Given , we can define the equivalence class containing : . We call a representative for the equivalence class.  In our previous example, there are two equivalence classes:    , which is the set of even integers.     , which is the set of odd integers.       Every integer is in an equivalence class, and the intersection of different equivalence classes is empty. This is called a partition of the integers.  In some sense, equivalence relations on a set are exactly partitions of that set:   Given an equivalence relation, the equivalence classes form a partition (as in the integer example).    Given a partition, we can define an equivalence relation (see the next example).           Partitions   Let and the partition of given by .

Two graphs with three vertices and one edge. In one graph the edge is between vertex 1 and 2. In the other the edge is between vertex 1 and 3.  We'd like to consider two graphs equal if we can re-label the vertices of one graph to get the other. For example, this can be done with the two graphs shown above. Determine the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation on the set of all graphs with vertices.    See the example in the textbook at the end of section II.4 .      "
