                            Given a relation <m>R</m>, there can be other meaningful relations that are implied.
                            There are some natural operations on <m>R</m> that allow us to express these implied 
                            relations explicitly.

                            for convenience later) by the rule "is a parent of". Let's explore some implied relations 
                            in this example and how we can construct them explicitly.
