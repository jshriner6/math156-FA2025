                            There are many cases when it's desirable to "loosen" our concept of equality. For example,
                            in most contexts we accept the equality
                            <me>
                                2+3 = 5
                            </me>
                            even though the two sides of the equality contain different looking symbols. This is captured
                            in the concept of an <term>equivalence relation</term>.

                            This is an equivalence relation because

                                        It is symmetric: If <m>a-b</m> is even, then <m>b-a = -(a-b)</m> is even.

                                        Given <m>a \in \Z</m>, we can define the <term>equivalence class</term> containing 
                                        <m>a</m>: 
                                        <me>
                                            [a]= \{b \in \Z | aRb\} 
                                        </me>.
                                        We call <m>a</m> a <term>representative</term> for the equivalence class.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In our previous example, there are two equivalence classes:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    <m>[0]</m>, which is the set of even integers.
                                                </p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    <m>[1]</m>, which is the set of odd integers.
                                                </p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <p>
                                        Every integer is in an equivalence class, and the intersection of different
                                        equivalence classes is empty. This is called a <term>partition</term> of the 
                                        integers.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In some sense, equivalence relations on a set are exactly partitions of that set:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Given an equivalence relation, the equivalence classes form a partition
                                                    (as in the integer example).
                                                </p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li>
                                                <p>
                                                    Given a partition, we can define an equivalence relation (see the next example).
                                                </p>
                                            </li>

                                We'd like to consider two graphs equal if we can re-label the vertices of one graph to get
                                the other. For example, this can be done with the two graphs shown above. Determine
                                the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation on the set of all graphs with <m>3</m>
                                vertices.
