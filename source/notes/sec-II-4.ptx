                                A <term>graph</term> is a set of vertices (or nodes) along with a set of edges between those
                                vertices. For example, the following are two graphs with <m>3</m> vertices and <m>1</m> edge.

                                    <shortdescription>Two graphs with three vertices and one edge. In one graph
                                        the edge is between vertex 1 and 2. In the other the edge is between vertex
                                        1 and 3.

                                We'd like to consider two graphs equal if we can re-label the vertices of one graph to get
                                the other. For example, this can be done with the two graphs shown above. Determine
                                the equivalence classes for this equivalence relation on the set of all graphs with <m>3</m>
                                vertices.
