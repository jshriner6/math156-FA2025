                            Our last chapter introduced us to relations between sets. There is a common type of relation
                            that is used widely, which we'll explore in this chapter.

                            Since functions are relations, the domain and target are part of their definition.

                                        They have the same domain and target.

                                        They assign the same value to every element in the domain.

                            For example, if <m>f: \R \to \R</m> is given by <m>f(x)=x^2</m> and <m>g: \N \to \R</m> is 
                            given by <m>g(x) = x^2</m>, <m>f(x) \neq g(x)</m> because they do not have the same

                            Likewise, it's possible that two functions are equal even if their rules aren't written in
                            exactly the same way. See the textbook or our notes from class for an example.

                            Since functions are relations, we can represent them in many useful ways.

                            We can represent functions as equations, tables, graphs, and with words. It is useful
                            practicing converting from one representation to another, as the best representation will
                            depend on the question you are trying to answer.

                                    This is a function since every student has exactly one height.
