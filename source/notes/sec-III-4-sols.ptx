                            When discussing relations, we also defined the <term>complement</term> and <term>converse</term> of
                            a relation. In the context of relations that are functions, the complement relation is rarely 
                            a function (why?). However, the converse relation is more interesting. If we start with a function
                            relation, can we swap the domain and range and again obtain a new function relation? To answer
                            this question, we need to discuss two important properties of functions.
