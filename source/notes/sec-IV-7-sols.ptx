                                Consider coloring in a <m>1\times 1</m> square using the following step-by-step process.  For the first step, we draw a line vertically down the middle of the square and color the right half:

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the square has area 1, the area of the shaded region is 1/2.  For the next step, we draw a horizontal line through the remaining space and color in the top quarter:

                                At this point, the shaded region has area <m>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}= \frac{3}{4}</m>.  We continue this process, at each step coloring half of the remaining space.

                            Now, let's think about the area after <m>n</m> steps, where <m>n</m> is an arbitrary number.

                                Write down a sum that expresses the area after <m>n</m> steps. Write it in both expanded form and in sigma-notation.

                                <m>\displaystyle\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^{n}}= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{2^{i}}</m>

                                In the previous problem, you may have noticed a pattern in your final answers.  Use this to guess a simple formula for the area after <m>n</m> steps (in other words, simplify so your answer is no longer a sum).

                                <m>\displaystyle\frac{2^{n}-1}{2^{n}}= 1-\frac{1}{2^{n}}</m>

                                Based on this formula, what can you infer about the area of the shaded region as <m>n</m> tends toward infinity?  Does this make geometric sense?  Why or why not?

                            </p>
                        </statement>
                        <solution>
                            <p>
                                The area approaches 1 as <m>n</m> goes to infinity.
This makes sense, because the square has area 1, and the shaded region is always contained inside the square.
The non-shaded region gets cut in half each time, so the shaded area should approach 1.

                        <p>
                            Now letâ€™s talk about general geometric sequences and series.
A geometric sequence is defined by an <em>initial term</em> <m>a</m> and <em>constant ratio</em> <m>r</m>, and looks like this:
<me>
    a,\,ar,\,ar^{2},\,ar^{3},\,\ldots.
</me>
Partial geometric sums are just the partial sums of geometric sequences. That is, sums of the form
<me>
    S_{n} = a + ar + \cdots + ar^{n-1}= \sum_{i=1}^{n}ar^{i-1}.
</me>
Infinite geometric sums, on the other hand, are the limits of the partial sums (whenever these limits exist), and look like this:
<me>
    \lim_{n\to\infty}S_{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\big(a+ar+\cdots+ar^{n-1}\big) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} ar^{i-1}.
</me>

                                In a previous problem, the areas that you calculated were geometric sums with a specific initial term and constant ratio.  What was the initial term <m>a</m> in these sums?  The constant ratio <m>r</m>?

                                In a previous problem, we came up with a simplified expression for the area of the shaded region after <m>n</m> steps.
We will generalize this expression.
Let <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> be arbitrary numbers with <m>r\neq 1</m>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using the original definition of <m>S_{n}</m>, expand and then simplify <m>S_{n}-rS_{n}</m>. (Hint: Group like terms.
Most of them should cancel.)

                                If you did the above calculation carefully, you should get an answer similar to <m>S_{n}-rS_{n}=a-ar^{n}</m>.  Solve this equation to come up with a simple formula for <m>S_{n}</m>.  Check that this formula agrees with your formula from the first problem.
