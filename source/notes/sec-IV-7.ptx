                    <introduction>
                        
                            <p>
                                Consider coloring in a <m>1\times 1</m> square using the following step-by-step process.  For the first step, we draw a line vertically down the middle of the square and color the right half:
                                <image source="color1.png" width="50%">
                                    <shortdescription>Square getting colored.</shortdescription>
                                </image>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since the square has area 1, the area of the shaded region is 1/2.  For the next step, we draw a horizontal line through the remaining space and color in the top quarter:
                                <image source="color2.png" width="50%">
                                    <shortdescription>Square getting colored again.</shortdescription>
                                </image>
                                At this point, the shaded region has area <m>\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}= \frac{3}{4}</m>.  We continue this process, at each step coloring half of the remaining space.
                            </p>

                        <p>
                            Now, let's think about the area after <m>n</m> steps, where <m>n</m> is an arbitrary number.
                        </p>
                    </introduction>
                    <task workspace="1in">
                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                Write down a sum that expresses the area after <m>n</m> steps. Write it in both expanded form and in sigma-notation.
                            </p>
                        </statement>
                    </task>
                    <task workspace="1in">
                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                In the previous problem, you may have noticed a pattern in your final answers.  Use this to guess a simple formula for the area after <m>n</m> steps (in other words, simplify so your answer is no longer a sum).
                            </p>
                        </statement>

                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                Based on this formula, what can you infer about the area of the shaded region as <m>n</m> tends toward infinity?  Does this make geometric sense?  Why or why not?

                        <p>
                            Now let’s talk about general geometric sequences and series.
A geometric sequence is defined by an <em>initial term</em> <m>a</m> and <em>constant ratio</em> <m>r</m>, and looks like this:
<me>
    a,\,ar,\,ar^{2},\,ar^{3},\,\ldots.
</me>
Partial geometric sums are just the partial sums of geometric sequences. That is, sums of the form
<me>
    S_{n} = a + ar + \cdots + ar^{n-1}= \sum_{i=1}^{n}ar^{i-1}.
</me>
Infinite geometric sums, on the other hand, are the limits of the partial sums (whenever these limits exist), and look like this:
<me>
    \lim_{n\to\infty}S_{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\big(a+ar+\cdots+ar^{n-1}\big) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} ar^{i-1}.
</me>

                        </p>
                    </introduction>
                    <task workspace="1in">
                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                In a previous problem, the areas that you calculated were geometric sums with a specific initial term and constant ratio.  What was the initial term <m>a</m> in these sums?  The constant ratio <m>r</m>?
                            </p>
                        </statement>
                    </task>
                    <task workspace="1in">
                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                In a previous problem, we came up with a simplified expression for the area of the shaded region after <m>n</m> steps.
We will generalize this expression.
Let <m>a</m> and <m>r</m> be arbitrary numbers with <m>r\neq 1</m>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using the original definition of <m>S_{n}</m>, expand and then simplify <m>S_{n}-rS_{n}</m>. (Hint: Group like terms.
Most of them should cancel.)
                            </p>
                        </statement>
                    </task>
                    <task workspace="1in">
                        <statement>
                            <p>
                                If you did the above calculation carefully, you should get an answer similar to <m>S_{n}-rS_{n}=a-ar^{n}</m>.  Solve this equation to come up with a simple formula for <m>S_{n}</m>.  Check that this formula agrees with your formula from the first problem.

                        <p>
                            Recall that the value of a series is defined to be the limit of its partial sums, so that
<me>
    \lim_{n\to\infty}\big(a+ar+\cdots +ar^{n-1}\big) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} ar^{i-1}= \lim_{n\to\infty}S_{n} = \lim_{n\to\infty}\underline{\hspace{5cm}}.

                               Based on your formula for <m>S_{n}</m>, what can you say about the convergence or divergence of <m>S_{n}</m>?
                               Does it depend on <m>a</m>? Does it depend on <m>r</m>? For what values of <m>r</m> does the series converge? For what values does it diverge?

                                Using your formula for <m>S_{n}</m>, take limits to come up with a formula for the value of the sum of a general infinite geometric series.  Check that this formula agrees with the area of the square in the very first problem.

                            Now that we know how to calculate finite and infinite geometric sums, let’s get some practice with a few examples.
