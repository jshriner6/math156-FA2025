                            Intuitively, "continuous" means small changes in the input result in small changes in the output.
                            This leads to many useful properties of continuous functions, one of which is explored in this
                            section.

                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            Is there a solution to <m>x^3-\cos(x) = 0</m>?

                        <p>
                            We can start by letting <m>f(x)= x^3-\cos(x)</m>, and noticing <m>f</m> is continuous (it is 
                            a combination of continuous functions). Since <m>f(0)=-1 \lt 0</m> and <m>f(\pi) = \pi^3+1 \gt 0</m>,
                            the IVT tells us there must exist <m>c</m> such that <m>0 \lt c \lt \pi</m> and <m>f(c) =0</m>. If we'd
                            like to approximate what <m>c</m> is even closer, we can repeat the IVT in a similar fashion (see notes
                            from class).

                    <statement>
                        <p>
                            Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to approximate a solution to <m>x^3 + x + 3 = 0</m>.
                        </p>
                    </statement>
                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            We know <m>f(x) = x^3 + x + 3</m> is continuous since it is a polynomial. We could start by noticing
                            that <m>f(0) = 3</m> and <m>f(-2)= -7</m>. Therefore, the IVT tells us there must exist <m>c \in (-2,0)</m>
                            such that <m>f(c)=0</m>. The midpoint of the interval <m>(-2,0)</m> is <m>-1</m>, so we can compute
                            <m>f(-1) = 1 \gt 0</m>. Therefore, the IVT tells us there must exist <m>c \in (-2,-1)</m> such that 
                            <m>f(c) = 0</m>. Repeating four more times would tell us that <m>c \in (-1.25, -1.1875)</m>. Compare this
                            to the actual value of <m>c \approx -1.21341</m>.
