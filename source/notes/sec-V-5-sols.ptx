                            Determining how a function changes over time is at the root of many questions. We will review 
                            one way we can describe change for a function, and use it to develop a new way to describe
                            change.

                        <p>
                            We can use the <term>average rate of change</term> to describe how a function changes
                            between two input values.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For example, if <m>f(x) = x^2</m> then between <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=2</m> we can calculate
                            <me>
                                AROC_{[0,2]} = \frac{f(2) - f(0)}{2-0} = 2
                            </me>.
                            The number <m>2</m> describes the slope of the <term>secant line</term> connecting the points
                            <m>(0,f(0))</m> and <m>(2,f(2)</m>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another equivalent way to compute average rate of change is using a <term>difference quotient</term>.
                            A difference quotient calculates the average rate of change between points <m>(x,f(x))</m> and
                            <m>(x+h, f(x+h))</m>:
                            <me>
                                AROC_{[x,x+h]}= \frac{f(x+h)- f(x)}{h}
                            </me>.

                        <p>
                            We can use the <term>instantaneous rate of change</term> to describe how a function changes
                            at a single input value. See the <url href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qlzwrqxbnv">IROC interactive</url>
                            to visualize how we define IROC from AROC. Using limit notation, we write
                            <me>
                                IROC_{x=x_0} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x_0+h)- f(x_0)}{h}

                        <p>
                            Note that instead of <m>IROC_{x=x_0}</m>, we typically write <m>f'(x_0)</m> ("f prime at x zero", or 
                            "the derivative of f at x zero"). Also note 
                            that limits need not exist, so the derivative of a function at an input value may not exist. If <m>f'(x_0)</m> does
                            exist, we say <m>f</m> is <term>differentiable at <m>x_0</m></term>.

                            The value <m>f'(2) =4</m> describes the slope of the <term>tangent line</term> to <m>f</m> at 
                            <m>x=2</m>. This line is important, and once we have its slope, we can write down the equation of 
                            the line using point-slope form:
