                            We developed the derivative to help us describe how functions change (recall, the derivative 
                            is also known as the instantaneous rate of change). This chapter will explore some common
                            applications of derivatives towards this goal.

                            the point <m>(x_0,f(x_0))</m> is a <term>critical point</term> of the function <m>f(x)</m>.

                            One perspective is that if we can find the critical points of a continuous function, then we 
                            can use the derivative to describe the increasing/decreasing behavior of the function on its
                            entire domain.

                        <p>
                            Describe where <m>f(x) = \frac{3}{2}x^4 + 2x^3 - 6x^2 + \frac{5}{4}</m> is increasing and decreasing.

                        <p>
                            We can compute <m>f'(x) = 6x^3 + 6x^2 -12x</m>, and notice that <m>f'(x)=0 </m> when <m>x=0,-2,1</m>,
                            and <m>f'(x)</m> exists for all <m>x</m> values. So the critical points of <m>f</m> are at <m>x=0,-2,1</m>.

                            Using a first derivative sign chart as shown in class, we find that the first derivative is 
                            negative on <m>(-\infty,-2)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m>, and positive on <m>(-2,0)</m> and <m>(2,\infty)</m>.
                            Therefore, the function <m>f</m> decreases on <m>(-\infty,-2)</m> and <m>(0,1)</m>, and increases on

                            We can compute <m>g'(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3} + 1</m>, and notice that <m>g'(x)=0 </m> when <m>x=-\frac{8}{27}</m>,
                            and <m>g'(x)</m> does not exist for <m>x=0</m> (which is in the domain of <m>g</m>). So the critical points of <m>g</m> are at <m>x=0,-\frac{8}{27}</m>.

                            Therefore, the function <m>g</m> increases on <m>(-\infty,-\frac{8}{27})</m> and <m>(0,\infty)</m>, and decreases on
