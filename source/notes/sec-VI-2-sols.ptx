                            We've seen that local extrema are critical points, but not all critical points are local
                            extrema. So the general strategy for finding local extrema of <m>f</m> is to identify all
                            critical points of <m>f</m>, and then find a way to test these critical points.

                            this produces some portion of a "U" shape. We say <m>f</m> is <term>concave up</term> at <m>x</m> values
