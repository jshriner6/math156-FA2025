                            One important application of derivatives is to optimize functions, such as answering questions
                            like "What dimensions will maximize area?" and "How much product will maximize profit?". We'll 
                            look at how to answer such questions in this section.

                            A farmer has <m>60</m> feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular field, which borders a canal (so
                            needs no fencing on that side). What is the largest area they can enclose?

                            The relevant function to optimize is <m>A=xy</m>, where <m>2y+x =60</m>, or <m>x=60-2y</m>. This means
                            the area function becomes <m>A(y) = y(60-2y) = 60y-2y^2</m>, and the relevant interval for <m>y</m> is 
                            <m>[0,30]</m>. Then <m>A'(y)= 60-4y</m>, so <m>y=15</m> is a critical number of <m>A</m> in the interval
                            <m>[0,30]</m>. Testing end points and the crtical number, we see that <m>A</m> has an absolute maximum

                            You need to design a box with a square base and open top whose volume is 864 cubic inches. What is the 
                            minimum surface area of such a box?

                    </statement>
                    <solution>
                        <p>
                            The surface area equation is <m>S=x^2 + 4xy</m> with the condition that <m>x^2y=864</m>. This means we can 
                            write <m>S(x) = x^2 +3456x^{-1}</m>, with the relevant interval for <m>x</m> being <m>(0,\infty)</m>. We can
                            compute <m>S'(x) = 2x - 3456x^{-2}</m>, so critical numbers of <m>S</m> are <m>x=0, 12</m>, but we can ignore
                            <m>x=0</m>. We can test <m>x=12</m> using the first derivative test to conclude that it is a local minimum. Since 
                            it is the only critical number in <m>(0,\infty)</m>, it is also the location of an absolute minimum. Therefore, the 
                            minimum surface area is <m>S(12) = 432</m> square inches.
