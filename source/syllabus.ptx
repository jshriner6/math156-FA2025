          <title>Course Content and Structure</title>
          <p>
            According to the course catalog, this course covers <q>Sets; relations; number systems; functions; sequences and series; concepts of differential and integral calculus as relevant to computational science</q>. 
            These topics may sound abstract
              (and can certainly be presented that way), but also have deep and meaningful applications to the world around
              us. Our goal will be to understand these topics as mathematical objects, but also give proper attention to 
              their usefulness around us. 
          </p>
          <p>
              Our daily course meetings will emphasize active learning and a collaborative work environment. Please come to each meeting
              prepared with any preparatory work, a device to access our course textbook and activities, and a willingness to actively
              participate. You will be encouraged to use technology to explore and make sense of course topics, but this will 
              not be the emphasis of in-class assessments. Therefore, you may not use a calculator, cell phone, computer, or tablet on any quiz or test.

      <title>Assignments, Assessments, and Grades</title>
      

      <paragraphs>
        <title>Online Practice</title>
        <p> You will have roughly bi-weekly online practice assignments on
          <url href="https://www.myopenmath.com/index.php">myOpenMath </url>.
          They will typically be due on Fridays by 11:59 pm MT. Online practice assignments are an opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. 
          You can attempt a problem multiple times before the due date. Your allowed attempts are finite, so please 
          start assignments early and ask questions when you get a problem incorrect on your initial attempts. 
          I will likely not be available for communication the evening of the due date, 
          so please start early and plan to use help resources when they are available!
        </p>
      
        <p>
        You will need to create a (free) MyOpenMath account in order to access the homework. Use the following
        information to enroll in our course. If you have issues with enrolling, please let me know as soon
        as possible so you do not fall behind.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The course ID: 287913

        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that your homework scores do not automatically transfer to the Canvas gradebook. They will be transferred shortly
          after the due date of each homework set. You should always reference the Canvas gradebook for an accurate representation of your
          homework grades and percentages (not the gradebook in myOpenMath).

        <title>Quizzes</title>
        <p>
          Roughly every other Friday, we will have an in-class quiz that assesses topics we have covered in recent class meetings, which will be announced in advance.
          These will typically correspond with the due dates of the online practice covering similar material. 
          Quizzes will be comprised of questions similar to those in myOpenMath, as well as the Exercises in the supplemental
          <q>Notes</q> section of myOpenMath. If you exhibit appropriate effort in preparing for quizzes, there will also 
          be a corrections opportunity offered to earn points back on your quiz. Details of <q>appropriate effort</q> and 
          how to complete corrections will be shared in class. In general there are no makeup quizzes, but 
          your lowest quiz grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a very important component of our course for the following reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Learning is a process. You will be given multiple opportunities to master a concept, but you are expected to do so eventually.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Frequent assessment is good for learning.  Think of these quizzes as a tool for learning rather than just assessment. 
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Keeping up with course material is important.  These quizzes will be one way of informing both you and me about your progress in the course.

        <title>Exams</title>
        <p>
          We will have two in-class midterms, and one cumulative final exam
          during finals week.
        </p>
        <dl>
          <li>
            <title>Midterm</title>
            <p>
              The midterms are tentatively scheduled for Tuesday, October 14 (week 8) and Tuesday, November 18 (week 13), 
              in class.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <title>Final</title>
            <p>
              The final exam is scheduled for Wednesday, December 17 from 4:10pm -- 6:10pm, in our normal classroom. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The final will be cumulative, split into three sections corresponding to content covered on each midterm and content not yet covered on the midterms.
              We know that it can take time to learn new concepts. Therefore, if your percentage score in the first two sections exceeds your score on the corresponding midterms, we will replace your midterm scores with your section scores from the final. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <em>In general, makeup midterms will be administered during the final exam, unless you have a University excused absence. We will also consider requests from student case management.</em>

        <title>Grades</title>
        <p> Overall grade percentages will be calculated based on the following weighting:
          <ul>
              <li> myOpenMath (<m>20\%</m>) </li>
              <li> Quizzes (<m>20\%</m>) </li>

              <li> Final Exam (<m>20\%</m>) </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      
        <p>Letter grades will be assigned according to a scale no stricter than the following:

        Services include a food pantry, a meal-swipe program, pocket pantries, and in-person assistance with navigating 
        federal aid eligibility. The RAH page includes numerous resources as well as county, state and federal programs which 
        are described and linked. Furthermore, please notify the instructor if you are comfortable in doing so.

          <title>Classroom Behavior, Respect for Diversity and Inclusion</title>
          <p>
              Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. 
              Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and 
              sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, 
              color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran's status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and 
              gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the

              We acknowledge that many students have had experiences that have left them feeling excluded from the field of 
              mathematics. We also acknowledge that students from minority groups have been disproportionately impacted. 
              We are making this explicit statement because this unfortunate reality is inconsistent with the truth that you 
              can be successful in mathematics, regardless of your race, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. We are 
              committed to decolonizing mathematics into a field where every student feels supported in accomplishing the 
              hard work necessary to become better problem solvers. We learn more by listening to diverse perspectives, 
              and we hope you will be ready and willing to share yours in this course.

          <title>Religious Observances and Class Attendance</title>
          <p>
          CSU has a legal obligation to accommodate students' absences due to religious observances. For such an accommodation, 
          it is the student's responsibility to complete the Religious Accommodation Request Form at the beginning of each 
          semester and submit the request via the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs website. The Dean of Students 
          will communicate with the instructor regarding the student's absence and the student is instructed to discuss how 
          best to ensure an accommodation related to class conflicts. For religious observances that cannot reasonably be 
          anticipated at the beginning of the semester, students must follow the procedure above as soon as possible after the 
          course conflict is identified. If a student knows that a particular course or section of the course will have multiple 
          conflicts with his or her religious obligations, the student is advised to locate another course section or defer 
          taking the course to a different semester. In the event of a conflict in regards to this policy, individuals may 
          appeal using established CSU procedures. Instructors are advised to provide reasonable accommodations to ensure 
          compliance with CSU's obligations. See more details regarding attendance policies at

          <title>Discrimination and Harassment</title>
          <p>
              CSU is committed to providing an environment that respects the dignity and worth of every member of its community. 
              CSU strives to create and maintain a work and study environment that is fair, inclusive, and responsible so that 
              each member of the CSU community is treated with dignity and respect and is rewarded for relevant considerations 
              such as ability and performance. CSU has adopted a comprehensive policy to define the types of conduct that are 
              prohibited and to prevent harm arising from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, 
              domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. Conduct that is discriminatory or harmful under 
              the policy inhibits the achievement of the stated goals. All students, faculty, staff, and other persons having 
              business with CSU are expected to know and follow this policy.

          <title>Academic Integrity and the Honor Code</title>
          <p>
              We learn best together, which is why there is a large amount of collaboration built into our course structure. 
              However, there is a difference between learning together and using someone else's work. If you are wondering if 
              you crossed the line, ask yourself "Could I start over and redo this on my own, and would it basically look 
              like this?" If not, then you are submitting someone else's work (plagiarism). Copying solutions or statements 
              from the internet wihthout citing your source also constitutes plagiarism. We take academic integrity seriously,
              so all cases of plagiarized work or cheating will receive a 0 and will be submitted to the SRC.
          </p>
          <p>
              This course will adhere to the CSU Academic Integrity Policy as found in the Colorado State University General 
              Catalog and the Student Conduct Code. At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course 
              and a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services. See more details at
